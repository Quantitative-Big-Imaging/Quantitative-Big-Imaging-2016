The exercises are designed to offer a tiered level of understanding based on the background of the student. We will (for most lectures) take advantage of an open-source tool called KNIME (www.knime.org), with example workflows here (https://www.knime.org/example-workflows).  The basic exercises will require adding blocks in a workflow and adjusting parameters, while more advanced students will be able to write their own snippets, blocks or plugins to accomplish more complex tasks easily. \r\nThe exercises from last year (available on: kmader.github.io/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/) are done entirely in ImageJ and Matlab for students who would prefer to stay in those environments (not recommended)\r\n\r\n#### Assistance\r\nThe exercises will be supported by Yannis Vogiatzis, Kevin Mader, and Christian Dietz. There will be office hours in ETZ H75 on Thursdays between 14-15 or by appointment.\r\n\r\n#### Specific Assignments\r\n\r\n- 25th February - Introduction and Workflows (Christian Dietz, Intro to KNIME for Image Processing)\r\n - [Setup](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Exercises/01-Description.md)\r\n- 26th February - Image Enhancement (A. Kaestner)\r\n - [KNIME Exercises](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Exercises/02-Description.md)\r\n  - [Starting Data / Matlab Directory](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/blob/master/Ex2/matlab.zip?raw=true)\r\n - For students experienced in Matlab they can be found here [Matlab Exercises](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/blob/master/Ex2/Exercises_ImageEnhancement.pdf?raw=true)\r\n - For students experienced in Python there is an Jupyter notebook with the same exercises as Matlab [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Exercises/02-files/Exercises1-3.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Exercises/02-files/Exercises1-3.ipynb?raw=true)\r\n- 10th March - Basic Segmentation, Discrete Binary Structures\r\n - [KNIME Exercises](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Exercises/03-Description.md)\r\n - [Workflows](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Exercises/03-files/Workflows.zip?raw=true)\r\n \r\n\r\n### Feedback (as much as possible)\r\n - Create an [issue](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/issues) (on the group site that everyone can see and respond to, requires a Github account), [issues from last year](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2015/issues)\r\n - Provide anonymous feedback on the course [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dEtIX1ZXMzFacmdhRF9mQVpNaWtWTXc6MA)\r\n - Or send direct email (slightly less anonymous feedback) to [Kevin](mailto:mader@biomed.ee.ethz.ch)\r\n\r\n### Final Examination\r\n\r\nThe final examination (as originally stated in the course material) will be a 30 minute oral exam covering the material of the course and its applications to real systems. For students who present a project, they will have the option to use their project for some of the real systems related questions (provided they have sent their slides to [Kevin](mailto:mader@biomed.ee.ethz.ch) after the presentation and bring a printed out copy to the exam including several image slices if not already in the slides).  The exam will cover all the lecture material from Image Enhancement to Scaling Up (the guest lecture will not be covered). Several example questions (not exhaustive) have been collected which might be helpful for preparation.\r\n- [Practice Questions](https://rawgithub.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course/master/PracticeExam/exam.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n- [Overview](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/blob/master/Projects/Overview.md) of possible projects\r\n- [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnOOBjdH2wMXdFNzVUNEUUc1WG1Cb21Gb24xZnQ5dWc&usp=sharing) you signup for your project with team members and a short title and description\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Material\r\n- Course Wiki (For Questions and Answers, discussions etc)\r\n - [Main Page](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2016/wiki/)\r\n- Performance Computing Courses\r\n - [High Performance Computing for Science and Engineering (HPCSE) I](http://cse-lab.ethz.ch/index.php/teaching/42-teaching/classes/577-hpcsei)\r\n - [Introduction to GPU Programming](http://cse-lab.ethz.ch/index.php/teaching/42-teaching/classes/576-etvgpufall2013)\r\n - [Programming Massively Parallel Processors with CUDA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/programming-massively-parallel/id384233322?mt=10)\r\n- Reprodudible Research Courses\r\n - [Course and Tools in R](http://kbroman.github.io/Tools4RR/)\r\n - [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)\r\n","google":"UA-48238118-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
